# webserver-doc
A docker image which creates an postgres database parrallel to the sqllite one. Was planning on using it to help with tax calculation by allowing users to input one or more chia addresses and download a csv file containing all the payouts and block rewards with the correct fiat balance at the time.
Indexes on the postgres db are still not yet added.
